<p>This subsection contains units whose blocks are restricted to members of one or more <em>content groups</em>. We've created three content groups for this section:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test Content Group X</li>
<li>Test Content Group Y</li>
<li>Test Content Group Z</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that content groups are a content-level concept, not an learner-level one. Specifically, they content groups themselves do <em>not</em> contain learners. In order to test out this subsection, you will need to associate one or more <em>cohorts</em> (an LMS data model grouping course learners together) with the content groups. If someone has not already done so, it is easy to set up cohorts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to this course in LMS by clicking <span style="text-decoration: underline;">View Live</span> from Studio.</li>
<li>Click the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructor</span> course tab to navigate to the Instructor Dashboard.</li>
<li>Click the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cohorts</span> tab within the Instructor Dashboard.</li>
<li>Click <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Add Cohort.</span></li>
<ul>
<li>Give it a name (for example "Cohort X") and associate it with a content group (for example "Test Content Group X").</li>
<li>Select "Manual Assignment" and add a learner to it by email address.</li>
<li>Optionally repeat for Test Content Groups Y and Z.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, it should be noted that course staff (including global administrators) are implicitly considered to be part of every content group, whether or not they have been added to the associated cohorts.</p>
