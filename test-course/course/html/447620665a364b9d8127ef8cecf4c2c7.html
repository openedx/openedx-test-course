<p>Each unit in this subsection contains a instance of a "built-in advanced component".</p>
<p>Technically speaking, that means each unit contains a <strong>usage of an XBlock type</strong> which <strong>comes</strong> <strong>installed</strong> with edx-platform (either by being coded into edx-platform directly or by installation from edx-platform's base requirements) but is <strong><em>not</em> in one of the standard components categories</strong> ("Problem", "Text", "Open Response", "Video", or "Discussion").</p>
<p>The title of each unit is in the format "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example: $TAG</span>" where $TAG is the lowercase XBlock tag used to install and internally reference the block type.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Heads up! </strong>Several blocks in this subsection have just been added using their default template and haven't yet been configured in a useful way. Contributors, feel free to propose changes to the configurations of the blocks in this subsection to make the more useful.</span></p>
